# Agile Specification Language (ASL)

*ASL is not your grandpa's software requirements specification language. :)*

In short:
- Concise, simple, easy-to-read, fast-to-write documentation.
- Use your favorite text editor (UTF-8).
- Automate your UI tests: ASL can be transformed automatically to UI tests that verifies whether your software is according to the documentation. Say goodbye to such manual tests.
